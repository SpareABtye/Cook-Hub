                <p>{`             Welcome to my personal project that I am building to challenge myself and continue to learn React.js. What I envision is a 'Hub' that will store all of my information on cooking and general kitchen knowledge. Just like React and coding, all of it self taught and information that I find valuable and want to share. 
                
           This section is my only story for you and with that said, there will be no ridiculous story behind anything else that I share here. 99% of it is not passed down. It was simply beacuse me or my wife were craving something and I felt I could make it. So I did, I obsessed over it and would not stop until I got it to where I felt it was right. No matter how tired she was of korean fried chicken, I wasn't done until it was right. Over time I will catalog all of my recipes that I have built over the years and within will be non intursives tips and tricks. This is something that I think that I will continue and add newer and/or update recipes.
